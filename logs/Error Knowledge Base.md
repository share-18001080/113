**📋 Detail Log:** [`meson-log ver9 run19.txt`](Detail Logs/meson-log ver9 run19.txt)
**⚠️ Symptoms:** Build fails, Missing harfbuzz dependency
**🔍 Root Cause:** The libass build process requires the harfbuzz library, but it could not be found using pkg-config.
**🛠️ Fix Suggestion:** Install the harfbuzz library and its development headers. Ensure pkg-config can find it by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH or similar. If harfbuzz is installed in a non-standard location, provide the correct path to pkg-config. Alternatively, disable harfbuzz support in libass if it's not strictly required.
**📝 Type:** `DEPENDENCY`

### 🔴 ERROR-001: Harfbuzz dependency not found during libass build

**📅 Date:** 2025-10-17
**🔗 GitHub:** [Run #21](https://github.com/share-18001080/113/actions/runs/18589222542)
**🎯 Library:** `libass`
**🏷️ Version:** `ver9`
**🤖 AI Confidence:** 90%
**📄 Full Summary:** [`Build FFmpeg Android ARM32 Full Features LibASS COMPLETELY FIXED - ver9-fixed run21 20251017.md`](Error Summaries/Build FFmpeg Android ARM32 Full Features LibASS COMPLETELY FIXED - ver9-fixed run21 20251017.md)
**📋 Detail Log:** [`meson-log ver9 run21.txt`](Detail Logs/meson-log ver9 run21.txt)
**⚠️ Symptoms:** Build failure, Missing harfbuzz dependency
**🔍 Root Cause:** The Meson build system for libass could not locate the harfbuzz dependency using pkg-config. This indicates that harfbuzz is either not installed, not configured correctly, or pkg-config is not finding it in the expected location.
**🛠️ Fix Suggestion:** Install harfbuzz and ensure it's discoverable by pkg-config. Verify that PKG_CONFIG_PATH includes the directory containing harfbuzz's .pc file. If harfbuzz is installed in a non-standard location, explicitly set PKG_CONFIG_PATH before running the build. Alternatively, provide the path to harfbuzz using meson configure options.
**📝 Type:** `DEPENDENCY`

### 🔴 ERROR-001: Missing system font provider for libass compilation

**📅 Date:** 2025-10-17
**🔗 GitHub:** [Run #1](https://github.com/share-18001080/113/actions/runs/18591621474)

**📋 Detail Log:** [`meson-log ver10 run1.txt`](Detail Logs/meson-log ver10 run1.txt)
**⚠️ Symptoms:** Compilation fails, Missing font provider
**🔍 Root Cause:** Libass requires a system font provider (DirectWrite, Core Text, or Fontconfig) to compile. None were found, and `-Drequire-system-font-provider=false` was not set.
**🛠️ Fix Suggestion:** Install a system font provider like Fontconfig, DirectWrite (Windows), or Core Text (macOS). Alternatively, if you don't need a system font provider, set the Meson option `-Drequire-system-font-provider=false` during configuration. Ensure the necessary dependencies for the chosen font provider are also installed.
